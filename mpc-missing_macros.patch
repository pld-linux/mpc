+# SYNOPSIS
+#
+#   AX_APPEND_LINK_FLAGS([FLAG1 FLAG2 ...], [FLAGS-VARIABLE], [EXTRA-FLAGS])
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   For every FLAG1, FLAG2 it is checked whether the linker works with the
+#   flag.  If it does, the flag is added FLAGS-VARIABLE
+#
+#   If FLAGS-VARIABLE is not specified, the linker's flags (LDFLAGS) is
+#   used. During the check the flag is always added to the linker's flags.
+#
+#   If EXTRA-FLAGS is defined, it is added to the linker's default flags
+#   when the check is done.  The check is thus made with the flags: "LDFLAGS
+#   EXTRA-FLAGS FLAG".  This can for example be used to force the linker to
+#   issue an error when a bad flag is given.
+#
+#   NOTE: This macro depends on the AX_APPEND_FLAG and AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG.
+#   Please keep this macro in sync with AX_APPEND_COMPILE_FLAGS.

+# SYNOPSIS
+#
+#   AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG(FLAG, [ACTION-SUCCESS], [ACTION-FAILURE], [EXTRA-FLAGS])
+#
+# DESCRIPTION
+#
+#   Check whether the given FLAG works with the linker or gives an error.
+#   (Warnings, however, are ignored)
+#
+#   ACTION-SUCCESS/ACTION-FAILURE are shell commands to execute on
+#   success/failure.
+#
+#   If EXTRA-FLAGS is defined, it is added to the linker's default flags
+#   when the check is done.  The check is thus made with the flags: "LDFLAGS
+#   EXTRA-FLAGS FLAG".  This can for example be used to force the linker to
+#   issue an error when a bad flag is given.
+#
+#   NOTE: Implementation based on AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION. Please keep this
+#   macro in sync with AX_CHECK_{PREPROC,COMPILE}_FLAG.
